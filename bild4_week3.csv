TERM,SCHEMA
Positive Control,"Definition: A control group in an experiment that is expected to produce a known effect and is used to ensure that the experimental setup can produce reliable results; Course Example: In a PCR experiment, a sample with a known DNA sequence is used as a positive control to ensure the PCR process is working; Application: Ensures that the experiment can detect the effect under investigation, validating the experimental setup"
Negative Control,"Definition: A control group that is not exposed to the experimental treatment or variable and is expected to produce no response; Course Example: In an Ecoplate experiment, a well without any carbon source is used as a negative control to measure baseline color change; Application: Helps to confirm that any observed effects are due to the experimental treatment and not other factors; Common Misconception: Negative controls are sometimes thought to be unnecessary, but they are crucial for identifying background noise in experiments."
Shannon Diversity Index,"Definition: A mathematical measure used to quantify biodiversity in a community by considering both species richness and evenness; Course Example: Calculating the Shannon Diversity Index for microbial communities found in soil samples plated on Ecoplates; Application: Used to compare the biodiversity of different ecosystems or microbial communities; Common Misconception: Students often confuse Shannon Diversity Index with simple species count; however, it also incorporates evenness."
Richness,"Definition: The number of different, unique species present in a particular community or ecosystem. It can also refer to carbon sources metabolized; Shannon H increases as richness increases; Course Example: Counting the number of unique carbon sources metabolized from an Ecoplate; Application: Important for assessing the biodiversity of a sample; Common Misconception: Richness only counts the number of species but does not account for how many individuals are present from each species."
Evenness,"Definition: A measure of how equally the individuals in a community are distributed among the different species present. Shannon H increases as evenness increases; Course Example: Two soil samples may have the same species richness but differ in evenness if one sample has species more equally represented than the other; Application: Evenness is used alongside richness to understand the overall structure of a community; Common Misconception: Students may overlook evenness and focus solely on richness, missing insights about community balance."
Biolog Ecoplate,"Definition: A tool used to measure the functional diversity of a microbial community by analyzing the utilization of various carbon sources in the microplate wells such as carboxylic acids, carbohydrates, amino acids, polymers, and amines; Course Example: Using Ecoplates to assess the functional diversity of bacteria isolated from soil samples; Application: Helps in identifying the metabolic capabilities of a community; Common Misconception: Ecoplates are often mistaken for tools that identify species, but they actually assess functional diversity."
Bacterial vs. Fungal Colony Morphology,"Definition: The distinct physical characteristics that differentiate bacterial colonies (e.g., smooth, shiny) from fungal colonies (e.g., fuzzy, large) when grown on agar plates; Application: Used in microbiology for the identification of organisms based on growth patterns; Common Misconception: Students may confuse colony morphology with individual cell morphology; colony morphology refers to the appearance of the whole colony."
Functional Biodiversity,"Definition: The range of different biological traits within a community, such as the ability to use different carbon sources, that contribute to ecosystem functioning; Course Example: Assessing functional biodiversity through the use of Biolog Ecoplates in microbial community analysis; Application: Important for understanding the roles that different species play within an ecosystem; Common Misconception: Functional biodiversity is sometimes confused with species diversity, but it specifically refers to the variety of functions performed by the organisms."
Incubation,"Definition: The process of maintaining cultures or samples under specific environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) to promote growth or chemical reactions; Course Example: Incubating Ecoplates for 1 week at 30°C to allow microbial growth and color development; Application: Used in labs to optimize conditions for the growth of bacteria, fungi, or other organisms; Common Misconception: Incubation times and temperatures vary greatly; assuming one set of conditions works for all organisms is incorrect."
Lactose Fermentation,"Definition: A metabolic process where bacteria convert lactose into lactic acid, often used as a differential marker in microbial identification; Course Example: Using MacConkey agar to identify lactose-fermenting bacteria by the color change in the media; Application: Helps distinguish between different types of bacteria, particularly in clinical and environmental samples; Common Misconception: Students often assume all bacteria can ferment lactose, but only specific bacteria possess this ability."
Percent Moisture,"Definition: The amount of water present in a sample, expressed as a percentage, often measured to assess environmental conditions affecting microbial growth; it is the ratio of water mass over dry soil mass; Course Example: Measuring soil moisture in samples to understand how it affects microbial community composition; Application: Used in environmental microbiology to determine the water content in soil and its impact on microbial growth; Common Misconception: Percent moisture is sometimes confused with water potential, but they are different concepts related to water in soil."
A590,"Definition: A measurement of absorbance at 590 nm wavelength, typically used in spectrophotometry to quantify the concentration of substances in a sample; Course Example: Measuring the absorbance of microbial growth in an Ecoplate well to determine metabolic activity; Application: Commonly used to assess cell density and metabolic activity in microbial cultures"
100% Stacked Bar Graph,"Definition: A bar graph where each bar represents 100% of a category, and different segments within each bar represent relative proportions of subcategories; Course Example: Visualizing the relative abundance of different microbial species across various samples; Application: Useful for showing proportions within a whole, such as species composition in different environments; Common Misconception: Students sometimes confuse stacked bar graphs with grouped bar graphs, which show different data."
Chi-Squared Test,"Definition: A statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables; Course Example: Using a Chi-squared test to analyze contingency tables from microbial data; Application: Frequently applied in hypothesis testing for categorical data in biology; Common Misconception: Students may incorrectly apply the test to continuous data, which requires different statistical methods."
Culture-Dependent Methods,"Definition: Experimental techniques that involve the growth of microorganisms in laboratory conditions, typically on solid or liquid media; Course Example: Isolating bacteria from soil by culturing them on TSA plates; Application: Used to study microorganisms that can be grown in lab environments; Common Misconception: Culture-dependent methods do not capture all species in a community, as some microbes cannot be cultured under standard conditions."
Culture-Independent Methods,"Definition: Techniques used to study microorganisms without the need to culture them, often relying on DNA sequencing or other molecular methods; Course Example: Sequencing microbial DNA directly from soil samples to analyze community composition; Application: Provides a more complete view of microbial diversity, including unculturable species; Common Misconception: Culture-independent methods are often mistaken for providing direct functional data, but they primarily provide genetic information."
Placebo Effect,"Definition: A phenomenon where a participant experiences a perceived improvement in condition due to their belief in the effectiveness of a treatment, even if the treatment is inactive; Course Example: Testing the placebo effect in a clinical trial involving a new antibiotic for bacterial infections; Application: Important in experimental design to differentiate between true effects and psychological effects; Common Misconception: The placebo effect is often thought to be the same as no treatment, but it actively involves participant perception."
How to Master a Math Equation in Biology: GIVeRS,"Definition: A systematic approach to solving mathematical equations in biology by breaking down the problem into Goals, Variables, Relationships, and Simple Examples; Course Example: Applying GIVeRS to solve problems involving population growth models or diversity indices, such as the Shannon Diversity Index (H); Example: GIVeRS for Shannon Diversity Index calculation: 1. **Goal**: Calculate the Shannon Diversity Index (H) to measure species diversity in a sample; 2. **Variables**: pi: Proportion of each species in the total sample (e.g., Species A has 40 individuals in a sample of 100, so pi for Species A = 40/100 = 0.4); 3. **Relationships**: The equation for Shannon H is: H = -∑(pi * ln(pi)), where pi is the proportion of each species and ln(pi) is the natural logarithm of pi; 4. **Simple Example**: Suppose a sample has 3 species with the following proportions: Species A: pi = 0.6; Species B: pi = 0.3; Species C: pi = 0.1. Applying the formula: H = -[(0.6 * ln(0.6)) + (0.3 * ln(0.3)) + (0.1 * ln(0.1))]; H ≈ -[(0.6 * -0.51) + (0.3 * -1.20) + (0.1 * -2.30)]; H ≈ 0.307 + 0.36 + 0.23 = 0.897; 5. **Solution**: The Shannon Diversity Index for the sample is H ≈ 0.897, indicating a moderate level of diversity; Application: The GIVeRS approach helps break down complex equations like Shannon H into manageable steps, making it easier to solve them in a structured way; Common Misconception: Students often skip the step of defining relationships and variables, leading to confusion in applying the formula correctly."
Correlation Matrix,"Definition: A table that shows the correlation coefficients between multiple variables, indicating the strength and direction of their relationships; Course Example: Creating a correlation matrix to compare microbial abundance with environmental factors like pH and moisture; Application: Useful for identifying patterns and relationships in large datasets; Common Misconception: Students often interpret correlation as causation, when it actually only measures association."
Excel function IF(),"Definition: A logical function in Excel that performs an action if a condition is true and another action if the condition is false; Course Example: Using IF statements to calculate pass/fail results based on threshold values in experimental data. For example, =IF(A1>70, 'Pass', 'Fail') will return 'Pass' if the value in A1 is greater than 70, otherwise, it returns 'Fail'; Application: Useful in analyzing lab results and automating decisions in spreadsheets, such as categorizing samples based on results; Common Misconception: IF statements are often incorrectly nested or overly complex, leading to errors in decision trees. For example, improper nesting like =IF(A1>70, IF(A2<50, 'Check'), 'Fail') can cause confusion."
Excel function SUM(),"Definition: A basic Excel function that adds up a range of selected cells and returns the total sum. For example, =SUM(A1:A10) will add up all the values from cells A1 to A10; Course Example: Summing the values from multiple experimental trials to calculate a total. For example, =SUM(B1:B5) might be used to sum the total growth measurements of a microbial sample over five trials; Application: Widely used in data analysis for calculating totals and averages; Common Misconception: Incorrect cell ranges are often selected, leading to inaccurate totals. For instance, if one accidentally selects an extra row like =SUM(A1:A11), it can skew results."
Use of $ within Excel Functions,"Definition: In Excel, the $ symbol is used to create absolute cell references, locking the cell address in formulas when copying them to other cells. For example, using $A$1 in a formula like =B1*$A$1 ensures that A1 remains constant when copied to other cells; Course Example: Locking reference cells in a formula that is copied across a range of cells in data analysis. For instance, =B1*$A$1 when copied down a column will still reference A1 while B1 changes; Application: Essential for accurate data manipulation when formulas need to maintain certain cell references; Common Misconception: Students often forget to use the $ symbol, causing formulas to reference unintended cells when copied. For example, copying =A1*B1 without $ will lead to incorrect results when the formula shifts."
