16S rRNA Gene,"The 16S rRNA gene is used in bacterial identification and classification due to its highly conserved regions and variable regions that differ between species. In BILD 4, you will amplify and sequence this gene to identify bacteria present in your soil samples."
Denaturation in PCR,"Denaturation in PCR is the first step where double-stranded DNA is heated to 95°C to separate the strands, allowing primers to bind during the annealing step."
Annealing in PCR,"Annealing in PCR is the step where the temperature is lowered to allow primers to bind to complementary sequences on single-stranded DNA templates. The annealing temperature must match the melting temperature of the primers, typically between 50-65°C."
Extension in PCR,"Extension in PCR occurs when Taq DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands by adding nucleotides to the primers. This step typically occurs at 72°C, the optimal temperature for Taq polymerase."
Thermocycler,"A thermocycler is a laboratory instrument that automates the PCR process by cycling through the necessary temperatures for denaturation, annealing, and extension. In BILD 4, you will program and use a thermocycler to amplify the 16S rRNA gene."
Primers in PCR,"Primers are short sequences of nucleotides that bind to specific regions of the target DNA during PCR. Proper primer design is essential to ensure specific binding and successful amplification of the desired DNA sequence. In BILD 4, primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene are used to identify bacterial species."
Agarose Gel,"Agarose gel is used in gel electrophoresis to separate DNA fragments based on size. In BILD 4, you will use agarose gels to visualize the results of your PCR and confirm the size of the amplified 16S rRNA gene."
Gel Electrophoresis,"Gel electrophoresis separates nucleic acids or proteins based on their size and charge by applying an electric current through a gel matrix. DNA is negatively charged and moves toward the positive electrode, with smaller fragments moving faster through the gel. This technique will allow you to check the success of your PCR reactions in BILD 4."
DNA Ladder,"A DNA ladder is a molecular weight marker containing DNA fragments of known sizes used as a reference to determine the size of DNA fragments in gel electrophoresis. In BILD 4, you will compare your PCR products to a DNA ladder to verify their size."
Loading Dye,Loading dye is a colored dye mixed with DNA samples before loading into a gel for electrophoresis. It helps visualize the progress of the migration and also contains glycerol or sucrose to make the sample denser so it sinks into the wells of the gel.
SybrSafe Dye,"SybrSafe Dye is a fluorescent dye used to stain nucleic acids in gel electrophoresis, allowing visualization of DNA or RNA under UV or blue light. You will use SybrSafe in BILD 4 to visualize your DNA bands on the agarose gel."
Genetic Engineering,"Genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of an organism’s genes using biotechnology, often to introduce new traits or enhance certain biological functions. Techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 allow for precise gene edits."
CRISPR-Cas9,"CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing tool that allows for precise modification of DNA within an organism, utilizing the Cas9 protein to cut DNA and a guide RNA to direct the location of the cut. In BILD 4, you may discuss the potential applications of CRISPR in microbiome research."

Nucleotide,"Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA, consisting of a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group. They are the substrate for DNA polymerase during PCR."
Antiparallel strands,"Antiparallel strands refer to the opposite orientation of the two strands of DNA in a double helix, where one strand runs 5' to 3' and the other runs 3' to 5'. This orientation is crucial for DNA replication and PCR."
What direction does DNA grow in? 5' or 3',"DNA grows in the 5' to 3' direction, meaning new nucleotides are added to the 3' end of the growing strand. This principle is fundamental for processes like PCR and DNA replication."
