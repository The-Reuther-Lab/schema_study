Natural Selection,"Course definition: Natural selection is the process by which individuals with heritable traits that enhance survival and reproduction are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. Over time, this leads to a change in the genetic makeup of a population, favoring advantageous traits.; Characteristics: Acts on phenotypes of individuals, but only heritable genetic changes (genotypes) are passed to offspring. Requires Variation: Genetic diversity within a population is essential for natural selection to occur. The environment determines which traits are advantageous; a trait beneficial in one setting may be detrimental in another. Over generations, natural selection can result in populations that are better adapted to their environments.; Misconceptions: While natural selection favors traits that increase fitness, it does not work towards a specific goal or perfect organism.; Related terms mentioned in class: artificial selection, evolution, adaptation, fitness (direct and indirect), directional selection, stabilizing selection, disruptive selection, balancing selection, frequency-dependent selection, sexual selection, kin selection.; Scientists mentioned in class: Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Hopi Hoekstra, Rosemary and Peter Grant, Rosemary Gillespie, and Paul Turner."
Sexual Selection,"Associated lectures: Week 3 Monday; Associated Assessments: Quiz 3, Midterm 1, Final Exam, Discussion Board Post Week 4; Resources: https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/19-3-adaptive-evolution"
Mutation,"Examples discussed in class: Antibiotic resistance in bacteria, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology."
Genetic Drift,"Related course learning objectives: Define genetic drift and explain its effects on allele frequencies and richness in small populations. Describe the founder effect and how it can lead to genetic drift. Understand the role of genetic drift in the development of new species. Discuss the impact of genetic drift on the genetic makeup of populations. Compare and contrast genetic drift with natural selection as drivers of evolution."
Gene Flow,""
Shannon Diversity Index,"1. **Goal**: Calculate the Shannon Diversity Index (H) to measure species diversity in a sample; 2. **Variables**: pi: Proportion of each species in the total sample (e.g., Species A has 40 individuals in a sample of 100, so pi for Species A = 40/100 = 0.4); 3. **Relationships**: The equation for Shannon H is: H = -∑(pi * ln(pi)), where pi is the proportion of each species and ln(pi) is the natural logarithm of pi; 4. **Simple Example**: Suppose a sample has 3 species with the following proportions: Species A: pi = 0.6; Species B: pi = 0.3; Species C: pi = 0.1. Applying the formula: H = -[(0.6 * ln(0.6)) + (0.3 * ln(0.3)) + (0.1 * ln(0.1))]; H ≈ -[(0.6 * -0.51) + (0.3 * -1.20) + (0.1 * -2.30)]; H ≈ 0.307 + 0.36 + 0.23 = 0.897; 5. **Solution**: The Shannon Diversity Index for the sample is H ≈ 0.897, indicating a moderate level of diversity; Application: Used to compare the biodiversity of different ecosystems or communities. This step-wise approach helps break down complex equations like Shannon H into manageable steps, making it easier to solve them in a structured way"
Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU),"Definition: Funded research programs for undergraduate students, often during summer breaks. Sponsored by: National Science Foundation (NSF) and other organizations. Benefits: Stipend, housing, hands-on research experience. Application process: Typically includes transcripts, essays, and letters of recommendation. Category: Research Opportunity"
Making a figure in R using ggplot2,"use the example of the gapminder dataset to explain how to make a figure in R using ggplot2"
p-value,"use the example of whether a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a particular locus to explain what a p-value is"
tidy data,"use the example of the gapminder dataset to explain what tidy data is"
Week 1 Learning Objectives,"1. Explain the mechanisms of evolution, with emphasis on understanding how natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation contribute to changes in allele frequencies within populations. 2. Apply quantitative methods to analyze biological diversity, including calculating and interpreting measures such as the Shannon Diversity Index and testing for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using statistical approaches. 3. Differentiate between various types of selection (directional, stabilizing, disruptive, balancing, frequency-dependent, and sexual selection) and provide real-world examples of each. 4. Evaluate common misconceptions about evolution, particularly understanding that natural selection is not goal-directed and does not necessarily lead to perfect organisms. 5. Connect historical and contemporary research in evolutionary biology by examining the contributions of key scientists (such as Darwin and Wallace) alongside modern researchers (such as Hoekstra, the Grants, Gillespie, and Turner) and their findings."
Course Regrade Policy,"Any student can request a regrade for any assessment. The request must be made within one week of the assessment being returned. The request should include a detailed explanation of why you believe the assessment was graded incorrectly. All requests should be in writing and email directly to the instructor. The course staff will review the request and make a final determination. This determination is final and there will be no further appeals."
Ask me anything about biology,"You are only allowed to talk about topics relevant to what a biology student would need to know to succeed in a biology course, graduate, and follow a path to a relevant career. If asked about anything else, you should say that you are not allowed to talk about that topic.For example, you can talk about the biology of bats, but not the history of bats in literature. You can talk about finding an appropriate graduate program or how to copy edit a lab report, but not how to write science fiction."
What are some effective study techniques?,"Effective Study Strategies for College Biology: Active Recall: Regularly test yourself on key concepts and terms to enhance memory retention. Use flashcards, practice quizzes, or Schema Study to reinforce learning. Spaced Repetition: Distribute your study sessions over time rather than cramming. This technique helps improve long-term retention of information. Interleaved Practice: Mix different topics or types of problems in a single study session. This approach helps improve problem-solving skills and adaptability. Elaborative Interrogation: Ask yourself 'why' and 'how' questions about the material to deepen understanding and create connections between concepts. Self-Explanation: Teach the material to someone else or explain it out loud to yourself. This helps clarify your understanding and identify gaps in knowledge. Metacognitive Strategies: Regularly assess your understanding and adjust your study methods as needed. Reflect on what study techniques work best for you. Mind Mapping: Create visual representations of the material to organize and integrate information, making it easier to recall. Healthy Study Habits: Ensure adequate sleep, nutrition, and exercise to support cognitive function and overall well-being."
