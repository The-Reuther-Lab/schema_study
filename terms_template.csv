Natural Selection,"Course definition: Natural selection is the process by which individuals with heritable traits that enhance survival and reproduction are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. Over time, this leads to a change in the genetic makeup of a population, favoring advantageous traits.; Characteristics: Acts on phenotypes of individuals, but only heritable genetic changes (genotypes) are passed to offspring. Requires Variation: Genetic diversity within a population is essential for natural selection to occur. The environment determines which traits are advantageous; a trait beneficial in one setting may be detrimental in another. Over generations, natural selection can result in populations that are better adapted to their environments.; Misconceptions: While natural selection favors traits that increase fitness, it does not work towards a specific goal or perfect organism.; Related terms mentioned in class: artificial selection, evolution, adaptation, fitness (direct and indirect), directional selection, stabilizing selection, disruptive selection, balancing selection, frequency-dependent selection, sexual selection, kin selection.; Scientists mentioned in class: Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Hopi Hoekstra, Rosemary and Peter Grant, Rosemary Gillespie, and Paul Turner."

Mutation,"Examples discussed in class: Antibiotic resistance in bacteria, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology."
Genetic Drift,"Related course learning objectives: Define genetic drift and explain its effects on allele frequencies and richness in small populations. Describe the founder effect and how it can lead to genetic drift. Understand the role of genetic drift in the development of new species. Discuss the impact of genetic drift on the genetic makeup of populations. Compare and contrast genetic drift with natural selection as drivers of evolution."

Shannon Diversity Index,"1. **Goal**: Calculate the Shannon Diversity Index (H) to measure species diversity in a sample; 2. **Variables**: pi: Proportion of each species in the total sample (e.g., Species A has 40 individuals in a sample of 100, so pi for Species A = 40/100 = 0.4); 3. **Relationships**: The equation for Shannon H is: H = -∑(pi * ln(pi)), where pi is the proportion of each species and ln(pi) is the natural logarithm of pi; 4. **Simple Example**: Suppose a sample has 3 species with the following proportions: Species A: pi = 0.6; Species B: pi = 0.3; Species C: pi = 0.1. Applying the formula: H = -[(0.6 * ln(0.6)) + (0.3 * ln(0.3)) + (0.1 * ln(0.1))]; H ≈ -[(0.6 * -0.51) + (0.3 * -1.20) + (0.1 * -2.30)]; H ≈ 0.307 + 0.36 + 0.23 = 0.897; 5. **Solution**: The Shannon Diversity Index for the sample is H ≈ 0.897, indicating a moderate level of diversity; Application: Used to compare the biodiversity of different ecosystems or communities. This step-wise approach helps break down complex equations like Shannon H into manageable steps, making it easier to solve them in a structured way"
